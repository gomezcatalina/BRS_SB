Table 3.8 summarizes the behavior of eight of the nine focal whales under observation during the experiments. As the precontrol behavior of Whale K on 24 August during AG 5 was possibly affected by the presence of the BIG VALLEY, this whale has not been included. Responses were noted at RSL ranging from 149 dB to 176 dB at distances up to approximately 4 km. However, in one case, RSL reached a peak of 165 dB with the NANCY H 0.66 km distant with very little, if any, response observed. We did observe the cessation of feeding with apparent movement away from the experimental vessel during some part of air gun sound exposure on five occasions. However, in three of these cases the whales resumed feeding either during the experiment (one case) or during the post-control period (two cases). In the remaining two cases, one whale stopped feeding with apparent movement away from the experimental vessel (Whale A, AG 3) and continued to move out of. the area during the post-control period; the other whale (Whale L) stopped feeding during AG 5; however, we do not have information on its pre-control movement pattern.Malme provided narratibve for each one of the behavioural reactions after exposure. As an example: Feeding, turn, speed increase, dive, fluke out, resumen feeding; whale kept feeding in the same general area. Whale B was observed to be feeding during the control period between AG 3 and AG 4 (see Fig. 3.28). Figure 3.29 shows the movement pattern of this whale relative to the NANCY H during AG 4. At the onset of AG 4, RSL at Whale B was 159 dB with the NANCY H 1.75 km to the north. Whale B continued to feed and between 1942-1954 was moving slowly to the north, toward the NANCY H, which was motoring southward. During this period, RSL was increasing and at 1957 it had reached 176 dB with the NANCY H 0.18 km directly offshore of Whale B. At this point, observers noted that the whale had turned and was moving rapidly to the south, diving with flukes out. This was the first time during the entire period of observation that Whale B displayed a full fluke out upon diving, and this action was unusual since the whale was in shallow water (depth K 9 m) in which fluke outs do not normally occur. The whale continued to move south, and at 2002 another full fluke out was noted. At this point, RSL had reached a peak of 177 dB with the NANCY H 0.17 km distant. Mud was observed with this dive, and Whale B was presumed to be feeding. The whale continued moving slowly to the south until approximately 2011, at which time it began to mill. By 2015, mud was again associated with Whale B, and the whale continued to feed throughout the remainder of AG 4, staying in the same general location. RSL at Whale B was decreasing during this period and by the end of the experiment was 159 dB, with the NANCY H 1.80 km to the southeast of the whale’s location. Whale B continued to feed during the post-AG 4 control and was last observed at 2042.",7,High,Avoidance,Not measured/reported

By the end of the pre-playback control periods, the whales had moved farther from Sequel than they had been initially. The closest whales were 2-3 km from the projector--about the same distance as the sonobuoys. Thus, noise levels received by the closest whales were similar to those at the sonobuoys (Table 2), and were equivalent to levels 12, 6-5 and 13 m from the drillship itself (cf. Greene, 1982). Levels received by the more distant whales were unmeasured but would have been several dB lowerDuring the 18 August experiment, noise pulses from a seismic vessel 60-73km away were detectable throughout both the control and playback periods at received levels up to 133dB1uPa. However, ambient, playback and bowhead sounds were detectable in the periods between seismic pulses.There have been very few controlled experiments involving drillship playbacks to non-migrating baleen whales. Richardson et al. (1985) and Richardson, Wells, and Wursig (1985) found some evidence for bowhead whale avoidance at distances of 2 - 3 km from the playback vessel with RSL at the closest whales ranging from approximately 100 dB to 112.5 dB.

Totals of 20 and 49 bowheads were seen within 5 and 10 km, respectively, during all surveys. Other whales were no doubt present but unseen below the surface. There was no clear evidence that the density of whales was lower near the construction operation, although their variable distribution made quantitative analysis impractical. The 12 bowheads seen within 5 km on 9 August were distributed all around the island. Industry personnel working at Issungnak reported 18 sightings of a total of 135 whales in August 1980. Several whales were estimated to be <500 m from the dredge. In contrast, neither biologists nor industry personnel saw many bowheads near Issungnak while it was being constructed in 1978 and 1979, and bowheads also were infrequent or absent there in 1981 and 1982 in the absence of construction (Richardson et aL, 1983a). The 1980 results show that bowheads sometimes tolerate considerable dredge noise and associated industrial activity. That noise was detected --~4.6km from Issungnak on 7 August 1980, and noise from the same
dredge operating in water 13 m deep has been detected at 7.4 km (Greene, 1982). The scarcity of bowheads in the Issungnak area in other recent
years was apparently a function of large scale year-to-year variability in bowhead distribution; it is not known whether reactions to industrial activity are one of the causes of this variation (Richardson et al., 1983a).",,,Not measured/reported,Not measured/reported

Wursig et al., in press b). On seven of eight occasions, there was no evidence that bowheads were moving away from the seismic vessels. On one day, 7 August 1982, the whales were moving westward, away from the track of the approaching vessel. However, this was probably part of a general westward movement at that time (Richardson et al., 1983a) rather than an avoidance response. Turning occurred during similar proportions of the surfacings with and without seismic noise (26 vs. 24 % on 20-22 August 1980, N = 27, 21 ; 23 vs 19 % on 14-19 August 1982, N = 31,37). Bowhead calls of the usual types (Wursig et al., 1982) were recorded on all six days when sonobuoys were deployed near whales exposed to seismic noise. Thus, we noticed no conspicuous responses to seismic vessels operating as close as 6 km from bowheads. Although we obtained no clear evidence that bowheads avoided seismic vessels, there sometimes was evidence of subtle alterations in surfacing, respiration and dive cycles. In four of seven cases, some variables differed significantly (P < 0.05) from values for 'presumably undisturbed' whales observed under similar conditions (Fig. 4). These results must be interpreted cautiously: (1) In each comparison, the whales observed in the presence and absence of seismic noise were probably different animals. (2) No one variable was consistently different. (3) In two of three cases when the seismic ship was within 13 km, 21 August 1980 and 25 August 1981, no significant differences were found.

However, during the 5 km experiment, echelon sizes were smaller while the airgun fired (means 4.7 before, 2.8 during, and 3.7 after airgun firing; lack of independence precludes statistical comparison). Also, the whales did not call for the 20-min period of airgun firing, but resumed calling thereafter (11 calls in 1.5 h before, 0 during, 57 calls in 2.1 h after). The latter results differ from the
aforementioned observations near full-scale seismic vessels, wherebowheads were calling. Mean durations of surfacings and dives, and mean number of blows per surfacing, were lower while the airgun fired, but not significantly so.

revealed that humpback pods which contained females
consistently avoided an approaching single operating air
gun (Bolt 600B, 20 cui chamber) at a mean range of 1.3
km. Avoidance manoeuvres were evident before standoff
at ranges from 1.22–4.4 km. In one instance a startle
response was observed. The mean air gun level for
avoidance was 140 dB re 1 ?Pa rms, the mean standoff
range at 143 dB re 1 ?Pa rms and the startle response
observed at 112 dB re 1 ?Pa rms. These levels are
considerably less than those observed from the operating
seismic vessel observations made outside Exmouth Gulf
and from those published for gray and bowhead whales.
More recent work on migrating bowhead whales has
shown air gun levels for avoidance less than those
observed for the resting humpback whales (W.J.
Richardson, LGL. Ltd. Canada, pers. comm.). For the
observations made of humpbacks here, it is believed the
differences in behavioural state of the animals at the
times of the respective exposures primarily accounted
for the difference in response levels. Pods containing
females and inside Exmouth Gulf were invariably resting
or attempting to rest. Resting was a particularly important
behavioural state for cow-calf pods. It is believed that
whales engaged in such behaviours were more sensitive
to the approaching air gun than animals involved in the
purposeful migratory swimming behaviour seen as the
animals passed through the region of the seismic survey
to the north east of North West Cape.",6,High,Avoidance,Not measured/reported

On 14 September about 18 Bowheads were noted within a radius of 2—3 km, initially singly or in scattered groups of up to seven. During the shooting the whales gathered gradually into a single close concentration of 12-14 individuals (Figure 3), with four to six others within 1 km. Those in the group surfaced and dived almost synchronously, remaining submerged on average for 10-12 minutes and surfacing for 4—5 minutes; because they were so tightly bunched we had difficulty determining precise times for individuals. At the surface they huddled closely, often touching, with snouts tending to converge. They emitted sounds intermittently. Due to refuelling requirements we had to leave after 1 hr 40 min of observation. On this occasion huddling appeared as a possible response to seismic shooting, though we once saw it with fewer animals when there was no shooting. we note that 'adults' appear to spend significantly longer at the surface when in the presence of seismic sounds. This indication, though contrary to that of Fraker and others (1982), is reinforced particularly by our observations of 24 September, when we had opportunity to watch the same group of whales before and after seismic shooting began.",5,Moderate,Not-avoidance,Not measured/reported

This individual slowly moved forward, non-directionally, while lifting its anterior body in an oblique, strikingly rigid, head-up position, in stark contrast with the normal ondulatory movements of delphinids. As evidenced by turbulent white-water in its wake, the dolphin produced a major propulsory thrust while attempting, initially successfully, to keep head and cervical region above the water surface (Fig. 3). This behaviour lasted for ca. 5 min when the dolphin increasingly struggled to maintain posture to keep head and cervical region above the surface (Fig. 3). Eventually it slid into a catatonic-like state of akinesia and postural instability as it, apparently passively, rolled over onto one side, then onto its back, exposing ventrum and tail. The dolphin was last seen sinking with minimal movements, some 300 m ahead of the airgun array, and merely 200 m from the observer (closest distance).

the activity patterns of porpoises remaining in the area.

Dolphins appear to adopt a noise-induced vocal compensation, thereby giving rise to species-specific shifts in frequency parameters, and finally increasing the frequency of their calls according to the level of environmental background noise. This is probably a compensatory strategy to maintain threshold levels favourable for communication.",4,Moderate,Not-avoidance,Vocalization frequency shift

The number of acoustic encounters increased during the Periodic exposure to Airmar signals, but very little during exposure to SaveWave signals, illustrating a gradual toleration of the Airmar signals over time, which may be caused by habituation of individual porpoises. The reason for the difference in response between the 2 pingers is likely that the Airmar signals were of constant repetition rate, duration and frequency, whereas the SaveWave signals varied in signal type, frequency, duration and repetition rate and were more audible to harbour porpoises.",6,High,Avoidance,Vocalization Rate Decrease
